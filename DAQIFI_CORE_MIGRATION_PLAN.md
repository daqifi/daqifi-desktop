# DAQiFi Core Migration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the iterative migration plan to gradually move functionality from `daqifi-desktop` to `daqifi-core`, creating a clean separation between core device communication logic and desktop-specific UI/application concerns.

## Current State (Updated 2025-10-16)

**Desktop (daqifi-desktop)**:
- Production-ready WPF application with 80% test coverage
- Comprehensive device communication (WiFi, Serial, USB)
- 1,073-line `AbstractStreamingDevice` with all device logic
- UDP discovery, channel management, data streaming, SD card, firmware updates
- Currently uses `Daqifi.Core 0.4.1`

**Core (daqifi-core v0.4.1)**:
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1-2 Complete**: Foundation and message system (59/59 tests passing)
- ‚úÖ Clean interfaces (`IDevice`, `IStreamingDevice`, `IMessageProducer`, `IMessageConsumer`)
- ‚úÖ Transport abstractions (TCP, Serial - UDP needed)
- ‚úÖ SCPI command producer (45+ commands)
- ‚úÖ Protocol Buffer support
- ‚ùå **Missing**: Device discovery, channels, streaming pipeline, advanced features (Phases 3-7)

**Integration Status**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **CoreDeviceAdapter (v0.4.1) NOT production-ready** - See Issue #39
- Integration attempted prematurely before core functionality complete
- Resulted in code bloat (143 lines added, 0 removed) instead of drop-in replacement
- **Recommendation**: Focus on Phases 3-7 before attempting integration

**Phase Progress**:
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Message System (Complete)
- üîÑ Phase 3: Connection Management (Partial - TCP/Serial done, UDP needed)
- ‚è≥ Phase 4: Device Discovery (Not started)
- ‚è≥ Phase 5: Channel Management (Not started - Critical gap)
- ‚è≥ Phase 6: Protocol Implementation (Not started)
- ‚è≥ Phase 7: Advanced Features (Not started)
- üö´ Phase 8: Desktop Integration (Deferred until 3-7 complete)

**Goal**: Clean up, stabilize APIs, and complete desktop integration

**Status**: Not started - ONLY after Phases 3-7 complete

**IMPORTANT**: This phase should NOT be attempted until Phases 3-7 are complete. Issue #39 demonstrates the problems with premature integration.

- [ ] Comprehensive documentation for migration path

### Desktop Migration Success Pattern
```csharp
// Before (legacy):
MessageProducer = new Desktop.MessageProducer(stream);
MessageConsumer = new Desktop.MessageConsumer(stream);

// After (CoreDeviceAdapter - should be this simple):
var adapter = CoreDeviceAdapter.CreateTcpAdapter(host, port);
await adapter.ConnectAsync();
MessageProducer = adapter.DesktopMessageProducer;
MessageConsumer = adapter.DesktopMessageConsumer;
// All existing message handling code works unchanged
```

### Desktop Migration Impact
Once complete, desktop can:
- Replace all device communication logic with core
- Reduce `AbstractStreamingDevice` from 1,073 lines to UI bindings only
- Remove duplicate SCPI command generation
- Remove duplicate connection management
- Remove duplicate message handling
- Focus desktop code exclusively on UI/UX concerns

**Deliverable**: Core 1.0.0 - Stable API for device communication

**Related Issues**:
- [#39](https://github.com/daqifi/daqifi-core/issues/39) - CoreDeviceAdapter issues (deferred to this phase)
- Phases 3-7 must be complete before this phase begins

## Implementation Guidelines

### Core Development
- Focus on cross-platform compatibility
- Maintain high test coverage (80%+)
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Follow .NET coding standards and conventions
- Comprehensive XML documentation for public APIs

### Desktop Integration
- Use adapter pattern during transitions
- Preserve existing public APIs until migration complete
- Maintain UI responsiveness with async patterns
- Keep desktop-specific concerns separate from core logic

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all core functionality
- Integration tests for device communication
- Desktop UI tests for user workflows
- Regression testing after each phase

### Version Management
- Core follows semantic versioning
- Desktop updates core dependency after each phase
- Maintain changelog for breaking changes
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout when needed

## Success Metrics
- **Functionality**: All existing desktop features continue to work
- **Performance**: No degradation in device communication performance
- **Code Quality**: Improved separation of concerns and testability
- **Maintenance**: Reduced code duplication between projects
- **Reusability**: Other applications can easily use core for DAQiFi devices

## Risk Mitigation
- **Incremental Rollback**: Each phase can be reverted independently
- **Parallel Development**: Core and desktop can be developed simultaneously
- **Testing Gates**: Comprehensive testing before each phase deployment
- **Documentation**: Clear migration guides for each phase
- **Community**: Engage with any external users early about upcoming changes

## Timeline Considerations
- Each phase represents 2-4 weeks of development
- Allow buffer time for testing and iteration
- Coordinate releases with any external dependencies
- Plan around major desktop application releases

This migration plan ensures a smooth transition while maintaining the desktop application's rich functionality and creating a solid foundation for future DAQiFi applications.
